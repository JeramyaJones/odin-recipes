        For fans of Ridley Scott’s Alien facing a holiday at home alone this year, there’s no better time to try a recipe that might not 
        be so at home during a traditional family get-together this holiday season. While the roasted chicken is a fairly traditional 
        choice for Christmas and other winter holidays, why not put a xenomorph-style spin on the old classic?
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredents</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>Desired spice rub & glaze</li>
        <li>3 feet of sausage casing</li>
        <li>Butcher’s twine</li>
        <li>1 additional boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>0.5 oz (roughly 1/2 teaspoon) transglutaminase powder</li>
        <li>8 crab legs, 4 left and 4 right (precooked)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>


        <li>Spatchcock the chicken.</li>
        <li>Remove the wings and legs, leaving the breasts and thighs intact with the skeleton of the bird.</li>
        <li>Flip the bird over, breast side up, and carefully remove the wings</li>
        <li>Press the bird flat into the board, placing gentle pressure on breasts with the palm of your hands. There will be some crunches.</li>
        <li>To create the tail combine the additional boneless chicken breast and transglutaminase powder in the bowl of a food processor along with whatever spices are being used on the chicken.</li>
        <li>Stuff the sausage casing.</li>
        <li>Add the tail to the chicken</li>
        <li>Place your creation into a 350℉ (175℃) oven for forty minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the crab legs</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
