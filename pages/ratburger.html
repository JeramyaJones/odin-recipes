    <p>Beer comes in cans, bottles and on tap. Its best served chilled during a hot day on the lake. If you drink to many you may experince discomfort. 
        Beer is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, 
        maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation
         in the resulting beer.[6] Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent.
